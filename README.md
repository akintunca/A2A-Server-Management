Idea: Manage all A2A servers from a single backend, IMPORTANT: Each agent must use MCP for agentic tools to take away work-load heavy tasks

# A2A Server Management

## Overview
Agent to Agent (A2A) server management implementation for distributed agent systems.

## Description
This project provides a centralized backend solution for managing multiple A2A servers. The system utilizes MCP (Management Control Protocol) to optimize agent workload distribution.

## Key Features
- Centralized server management
- Agent workload optimization through MCP
- Distributed task handling
- Automated resource allocation

## Requirements
- MCP integration for each agent
- Support for agentic tools
- Distributed server architecture

## Architecture
Each agent in the system:
- Must implement MCP protocol
- Handles resource-intensive tasks through delegated processes
- Communicates with central management backend
